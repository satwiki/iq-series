# Episode 1 Cookbook: Data, context, and tools at scale

This folder contains the hands-on cookbook for Episode 1 of The Work IQ Series.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Microsoft 365 Tenant** with proper licensing
- **Node.js** 22 or later installed
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** installed
- **Work IQ** enabled in your target tenant with **Administrative consent** for the **Work IQ application**
- **Work IQ CLI** installed

## 🛠️ Installing GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot CLI is available with all Copilot plans and provides a command-line interface to interact with GitHub Copilot. Choose the installation method that works best for your platform:

### Prerequisites

Before installing GitHub Copilot CLI, ensure you have:

- An active GitHub Copilot subscription
- Node.js 22 or later (for npm installation)
- PowerShell v6 or higher (on Windows)

> **Note:** If you have access to GitHub Copilot through your organization, make sure your organization has enabled Copilot CLI in their settings.

### Installation Methods

#### Option 1: Using npm (All Platforms)

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot
```

If you have `ignore-scripts=true` in your `~/.npmrc` file, use:

```bash
npm_config_ignore_scripts=false npm install -g @github/copilot
```

To install the prerelease version:

```bash
npm install -g @github/copilot@prerelease
```

#### Option 2: Using WinGet (Windows)

```powershell
winget install GitHub.Copilot
```

To install the prerelease version:

```powershell
winget install GitHub.Copilot.Prerelease
```

#### Option 3: Using Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install copilot-cli
```

To install the prerelease version:

```bash
brew install copilot-cli@prerelease
```

#### Option 4: Using Install Script (macOS and Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

Or using wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://gh.io/copilot-install | bash
```

To install to a custom directory, set the `PREFIX` environment variable:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gh.io/copilot-install | PREFIX="$HOME/custom" bash
```

#### Option 5: Download from GitHub

Download the executable directly from the [copilot-cli repository](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/releases/). Then unpack and run the executable for your platform.

### Authentication

On first launch, you'll be prompted to authenticate. Use the `/login` slash command and follow the on-screen instructions to log in with your GitHub account.

Alternatively, you can authenticate using a fine-grained personal access token with the "Copilot Requests" permission by exporting it as an environment variable:

```bash
export COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
# or
export GH_TOKEN=<your_token>
# or
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_token>
```

## ⚙️ Enabling Work IQ in your tenant

Follow this brief enablement flow as a tenant admin:

1. Verify licensing requirements are satisfied for users who need Work IQ.
1. Sign in with an eligible admin role (for example, Global Administrator or Application Administrator).
1. Grant tenant-wide admin consent using this URL:
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id}/adminconsent?client_id=ba081686-5d24-4bc6-a0d6-d034ecffed87`
  Replace `{your-tenant-id}` with your tenant ID (GUID) or tenant domain, open it in a browser, sign in as admin, then click **Accept**.
1. If the consent page returns access-denied/AADSTS errors, run the enablement script to provision missing service principals, then retry consent:
  `https://github.com/microsoft/work-iq/blob/main/scripts/Enable-WorkIQToolsForTenant.ps1`
1. Validate in Microsoft Entra admin center > Enterprise applications > Work IQ CLI > Permissions, and confirm all required permissions are granted for your organization.
1. Optionally restrict access by setting Assignment required? to Yes and assigning only approved users/groups.

For complete prerequisites, exact URLs/scripts, troubleshooting, and security guidance, see the full admin guide: https://github.com/microsoft/work-iq/blob/main/ADMIN-INSTRUCTIONS.md
